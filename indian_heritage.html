    <h1 id="cuisine">CUISINE </h1>
    <span>A cuisine is a style of cooking characterized by distinctive ingredients, techniques and dishes, and usually associated with a specific culture or geographic region. Regional food preparation techniques, customs, and ingredients combine to enable dishes unique to a region.[1]

        A cuisine is partly determined by ingredients that are available locally or through trade. Regional ingredients are developed and commonly contribute to a regional or national cuisine, such as Japanese rice in Japanese cuisine or New Mexico chile in New Mexican cuisine. Likewise, national dishes have variations, such as gyros in Greek cuisine and hamburger in American cuisine.
        
        Religious food laws can also exercise an influence on cuisine, such as Hinduism in Indian cuisine, Sikhism in Punjabi cuisine, Buddhism in East Asian cuisine, Christianity in European cuisine,[2][3][4] Islam in Middle Eastern cuisine, and Judaism in Jewish and Israeli cuisine.</span>

    <span>Clothing in India varies with the different ethnicities, geography, climate, and cultural traditions of
        the
        people of each region of India. Historically, clothing has evolved from simple garments like kaupina,
        langota,
        achkan, lungi, sari, well as rituals and dance performances. In urban areas, western clothing is common and
        uniformly worn by people of all social. <br>
        <br> Sometimes, color codes are followed in clothing based on the religion and rituals concerned. The
        traditional style of clothing in India varies with male or female distinctions. This is still followed in
        rural
        areas, though is changing in the urban areas.</span>

    <span>Among all the Indian heritage, architectural sites are the treat to the eyes of travelers from all over the world. Besides, Indians’ love for its rich history keeps these heritage sites alive. It is the duty of the older generations to invoke the same love and respect for these sites. They shall learn the significance and keep their willingness to preserve the heritage for future generations.<br>
    </span><span>Indian history is as rich as its culture. If we look at the architectural marvels of the heritage sites such as Hampi, Khajuraho, Taj Mahal, Lal Kila, Qutub Minar, Fatehpur Sikri, Bhulbhulaiya, these still hold immense significance in terms of their marvelous art, engineering, construction, and labor behind each site. There are many ancient and historical monuments that stand alive. Some of them took literally one decade to hundred years to be built properly. Such beautiful heritage sites are very rarely seen these days if we talk about modern-day architecture.<br>
        Hence, as responsible citizens, it is our duty to take care of these Indian heritage sites and monuments so that these could be preserved and witnessed by our future generations as well.</span>
